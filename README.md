# SIRC

**This is a simple program that tries to simulate a IRC chat**

## Features

  * Using Diffie-Hellman Algorithm to exchange the keys;

  * By using this key, the program generate the AES key and IV in a random way; :lock:

  * using threads to read and send.

  * Using a GUI to send and read messages :+1:

## TODOs:

  * Finish the implementation of:
      * Client side :ok:
      * Server side :ok:
      * GUI :clock2:
      * Key exchange :ok:
      * security module :ok:
      * commands (Like IRC) :clock2:

## BUGs:

  * To exit you'll need to kill the Threads (For while I'm using $ killall python ) :cry:.

**Program currently under development, therefore, there are a lot of work to be done.**  :tired_face:

# Requirements:
    * PyCrypto
    * Tkinter (Default)
