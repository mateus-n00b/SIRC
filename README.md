# SIRC

**This is a simple program that tries to simulate a IRC chat**

## Features 

  * Using Diffie-Hellman Algorithm to exchange the keys;

  * By using this key, the program generate the AES key and IV in a random way; :lock:

  * using threads to read and send.

## TODOs:

  * Finish the implementation of:
      * Client side :clock2:
      * Server side :clock2:
      * Key exchange :ok:
      * security module :ok:
      * commands (Like IRC) :clock2:

## BUGs:

  * To exit you'll need to kill the Threads and I don't know how to it :cry:.

**This project is still under development, therefore, there are a lot of work to be done.**  :tired_face:
