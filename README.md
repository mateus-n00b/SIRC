# SIRC

**This is a simple programs that tries to simulate a IRC chat**

##Features :+1:
  *Using Diffie-Hellman Algorithm to exchange the keys;

  *By using this key, the program generate the AES key and IV in a random way; :lock:

  *using threads to read and send.

##TODOs:
  *Finish the implementation of:
    *Client side
    *Server side
    *security module
    *commands (Like IRC)

##BUGs:
    *To exit you'll need to kill the Threads and I don't know how to it. :cry:  

**This project is still under development, therefore, there are a lot of work to be done.**  :tired_face:
